For next times:
1)I must test the new buffer and the new butterfly.
2)Create the other buffers and test them. --------------------
3)Complete the unit and test stage by stage 
4)Test the hole unit 
5)Create python scripts that create input siganls and their outputs in the correct format
6)Check for bigger number of sumples

7)Start new optimazations such us data width reduction


1) new multipliers, multipliless.
2) Bigger test samples (PSNR)
3) making pipeling equal in all stages
4) Test on better Fpga to reach higher frequencies
5) Maybe use Brams for buffers
6) Find pipelined DSP multipliers
7) Reduce datawidth more
